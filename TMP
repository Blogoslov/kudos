- In database, each assignment handin:
  - marked as "initialized" or "uninitialized"
  - marked as "active" or "inactive"
  - at handin initialization:
    - mark "initialized"
    - mark "active" unless specified otherwise (e.g., --no-activate)
      - if marked "active", save status in public database
      - if not marked "active", remove world r-x perms from handin
        directory
  - at activation:
    - check to make sure it's initialized (maybe offer to initialize with
      --initialize or similar)
    - set world r-x perms on handin directory
    - mark "active" in public database
      - if committing to public database fails, warn loudly (since r-x perms
        remain, but it's not marked active)
  - at deactivation:
    - check to make sure it's initialized?
    - remove world r-x perms from handin directory
    - mark "inactive" in public database
      - if committing to public database fails, warn loudly (since r-x perms
        have been removed, but it's still marked active)
  - at publication:
    - by default, mark "inactive"
    - if specified (ie, --activate), mark "active"
      - if all of the handins have not yet been initialized, fail and inform
        the user that they should initialize them first
